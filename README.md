variable "az" {
  default = {
    ap-northeast-1 = "ap-northeast-1a,ap-northeast-1c"
    ap-northeast-2 = "ap-northeast-2a,ap-northeast-2c"
    ap-southeast-1 = "ap-southeast-1a,ap-southeast-1b"
    ap-southeast-2 = "ap-southeast-2a,ap-southeast-2b,ap-southeast-2c"
    eu-central-1 = "eu-central-1a,eu-central-1b"
    eu-west-1 = "eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c"
    sa-east-1 = "sa-east-1a,sa-east-1b,sa-east-1c"
    us-east-1 = "us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1d,us-east-1e"
    us-west-1 = "us-west-1a,us-west-1c"
    us-west-2 = "us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c"
